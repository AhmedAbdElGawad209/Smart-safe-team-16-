Our project aims to upgrad the level of security, smartness and efficiency of normal safe.

### A description of what the project is for.

This should answer a short list of basic questions:

* **What is this repo or project?** Our project aims to upgrad the level of security, smartness and efficiency of normal safe.
* **How does it work?** the idea of our team is to build a smart safe which is connect to a mobile with a password and then 
can be remotely acessed by number of users with a permisssion of the owner. 
when an owner first use the project it will connect to the safe using blutooth and write the password for the safe 
then it is time for the members which they ineed for acessing the safe without the prensence of the owner to open the safe.
for the sake of  achieving this the owner give the members an ID which can identify the member. 
if the member insert it ID the safe will send a massage to the owner with the ID. 
owner has the choice to accept and then the safe open 
OR reject and then the safe stay locked and a rejection alarm is set . 
if the ID is not correct an alarm is set to warn from a robbing trial.  

The safe also contins anti move system :
     It has light sensor which sens if the safe is moved from its regular place setting alarm and warning the owner by massage.
* **Who will use this repo or project?** Anyone who want to enhace his safe smartness.
* it could be a family members who are all ineed to acess the safe.
* A job group or team who want to save a very secure papar of work ,but still easily acessed among the team.
